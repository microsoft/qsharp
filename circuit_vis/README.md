**quantum-viz.js** (or **qviz**) is a configurable tool for rendering quantum circuits. With the increasing demand for quantum libraries and educational tools, quantum circuits provide an intuitive way to visualize and understand quantum algorithms. quantum-viz.js is a lightweight library that can be easily integrated into any project. It aims to be easily configurable while allowing complex user interactions, such as toggling between different measurement outcomes.

## Getting Started
### Installation
Include `quantum-viz.js` in your HTML page by using it directly from CDN:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@microsoft/quantum-viz.js"></script>
```
or import it in into your TypeScript package:
```bash
npm i @microsoft/quantum-viz.js
```

### Usage
1. Create a `Circuit` JavaScript object (the `Circuit` schema is documented [here](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum-viz.js/wiki/API-schema-reference)):
```js
const sampleCircuit = {
    qubits: [
        // ...
    ],
    operations: [
        // ...
    ],
};
```


2. Draw it in a `div`:
```js
const sampleDiv = document.getElementById('sample');
qviz.draw(sampleCircuit, sampleDiv, qviz.STYLES['Default']);
```
