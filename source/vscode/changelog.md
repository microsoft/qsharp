Below are some of the highlights for the 1.20 release of the QDK.

### QIR target profile selection redesign

In previous releases, the target QIR profile setting for code generation in VS Code was a global setting, and if switching between projects with different target profiles the user would need to remember to change the editor setting each time. This was cumbersome and a common source of confusion.

With this release, the target profile can be set per project. If working on a multi-file project with a `qsharp.json` manifest file, the target profile can be specified in the manifest file via the `"targetProfile"` property.

If working in a standalone Q# or OpenQASM file, the target profile can be specified via the `@EntryPoint` attribute in Q# files, or the `qdk.qir.profile` pragma in OpenQASM files. For example, to target a Q# file for `base profile` code generation:

```qsharp
@EntryPoint(Base)
operation Main() : Result[] {
    // ...
}
```

If submitting a job to the Azure Quantum service, upon submission the target profile will default to the capabilities of the target hardware if not otherwise specified.

See the [QDK Profile Selection](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/wiki/QDK-Profile-Selection) wiki page for more details and examples.

### OpenQASM improvements

- Arrays and complex numbers can now be passed as input and output.
- Qubit aliases and array concatenation are now supported.
- In VS Code, OpenQASM files now support:
  - Rename symbol (F2) for user-defined identifiers, gates, functions, etc; built-ins are not renameable.
  - Go to Definition (F12) and Find All References (Shift+F12).
- The GitHub Copilot tools for the QDK now support OpenQASM (.qasm) files as well as Q#. You can simulate your program, generate a circuit diagram and generate resource estimates for Q# and OpenQASM programs right from the chat panel.

### Python interop improvements

In addition to primitive types, arrays, and tuples, users can now pass [Q# structs](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/wiki/Q%23-Structs). For example, the following shows passing a python object to a Q# operation that takes struct:

<img width="899" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b711a19e-3814-44bc-9df7-cefca2830609" />

Complex numbers are also supported, allowing the passing of Python complex literals and variables directly to Q# callables, e.g.

```python
import qsharp

qsharp.eval("""
    import Std.Math.Complex;

    function SwapComponents(c: Complex) : Complex {
        new Complex { Real = c.Imag, Imag = c.Real }
    }
    """)

from qsharp.code import SwapComponents
assert SwapComponents(2 + 3j) == 3 + 2j
```

For more details on Python and Q# interop see our [wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/wiki/Invoking-Q%23-callables-from-Python).

### Richer Copilot help for Q# APIs

In this release, we added a new Copilot tool that can access the documentation generated by all the APIs available in the current project (included the standard library and referenced libraries). This lets Copilot see up-to-date information on the Q# libraries available and how to use them, improving Copilot's working knowledge of Q#. From generated Q# snippets to answering questions about available APIs, Copilot can use this to provide more accurate and up-to-date information.

<img width="723" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/005cf3f5-7364-4ef4-ac00-b558d2d953c8" />

### Language service improvements

Numerous improvements to the language service have been made for correctness and completeness, especially around import and export declarations. The language service now also provides better diagnostics for QIR generation errors. Please log issues if you encounter any problems!

## v1.15.0

### New `QuantumArithmetic` library

This release is the first to add the `QuantumArithmetic` library by [@fedimser](https://github.com/fedimser) to the list of suggested libraries! Check out more about the library at <https://github.com/fedimser/quant-arith-re>.

### Measurement and qubit reuse decompositions handled in QIR generation

This change addresses a long-standing point of confusion regarding how programs compiled for QIR Base profile are displayed in places like the circuit visualizer. By delaying application of decompositions for deferred measurement and avoidance of qubit reuse to the QIR generation step, the stdlib implementation of measurement no longer needs to have a different implementation for Base profile vs other profiles. This should make the displayed circuits match the written code more often. See #2230 for more details.

**Full Changelog**: [v1.13...v1.14.0](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/compare/v1.13...v1.14.0)

## v1.13.0

We are excited to release v1.13 of the Azure Quantum Development Kit! Here are some highlights of features included in this month's release:

### `@Test` Attribute and VS Code Test Explorer Integration

[#2095](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/pull/2095) Introduced a new attribute, `@Test`, which identifies unit tests written in Q#. By integrating with the Text Explorer feature in VS Code, you can now explore, run, and review Q# unit test execution:

<img width="874" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9db628d-59b3-4f5a-8b52-8e466bd1b69c" />

See the wiki page on [Testing Q# Code in VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/wiki/Testing-Q%23-Code-in-VS-Code) for more information.

### "Q#: Add Project Reference" VS Code Command Enhancements

[#2079](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/pull/2079) enhanced the VS Code command for adding references to a Q# project, available when editing a `qsharp.json` file:

<img width="835" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2060070-9628-4723-8750-bb9b62442755" />

When invoking the command, you'll now see a choice to either import from GitHub or search the currently opened workspace for other Q# projects. When choosing GitHub, you'll get a suggestion of known libraries and their available versions to choose from, and the corresponding external project reference snippet will automatically be added to your current `qsharp.json`:

<img width="835" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d09d750b-ed50-4a79-b0b6-e6971574b88d" />

<img width="835" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/026f1aba-a043-46e4-82d6-223248dd10a0" />

### More Python Interoperability for Callables

[#2091](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/pull/2091) added more support for using Python functions that wrap Q# callables across our Python package APIs. This makes it easier to pass Python arguments into Q# for features like resource estimation with `qsharp.estimate()`, running multiple shots with `qsharp.run()`, compiling to QIR with `qsharp.compile()`, or generating circuits with `qsharp.circuit()`:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf3c4da1-ed2c-494d-8c04-d2db8a57fccd)

For more information on using Q# callables directly in Python, see the [Invoking Q# Callables from Python](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/wiki/Invoking-Q%23-callables-from-Python) wiki page.

### Adaptive Profile Floating-Point Computation Extension

[#2078](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/pull/2078) added support for an additional QIR Adaptive profile extension: floating-point computation. By choosing `QIR Adaptive RIF` as your compilation profile, you can enable **R**eset, **I**nteger computation, and **F**loating-point computation for code generation. This allows you to write programs where the values of variables with Q# type `Double` can be dyanmically calculated from measurement results at runtime, and the output QIR will include arithmetic and comparison instructions corresponding to your code, enabling even more adaptive algorithms.

**Full Changelog**: [v1.12...v1.13](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/compare/v1.12...v1.13)

## v1.12.0

We are excited to release v1.12 of the Azure Quantum Development Kit! Here are some highlights of features included in this month's release:

### Python interoperability improvements

You can now import and invoke your Q# callables for simulation directly from Python as functions. Your callables defined in `%%qsharp` magic cells, through calls to `qsharp.eval`, or loaded from projects in `qsharp.init` can now be imported from the `qsharp.code` module:

```python
import qsharp

qsharp.eval("""
    operation Superposition() : Result {
        use q = Qubit();
        H(q);
        Std.Diagnostics.DumpMachine();
        MResetZ(q)
    }
    """)

from qsharp.code import Superposition
result = Superposition()
```

For more details and current limitations, see [Invoking Q# callables from Python](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/wiki/Invoking-Q%23-callables-from-Python) in the wiki.

Syntax for capturing state dumps from `DumpMachine` or `DumpRegister` and operation matrices from `DumpOperation` calls in your Q# code has also been improved (see #2042)

### Deprecation of `set` keyword

The `set` keyword used for updating mutable values is now deprecated, so where you previously had to use `set x += 1` you can now just write `x += 1`. In addition, the compiler includes a new lint that defaults to "allow" that you can use to warn or error on usage of `set` in your code (see #2062).

### `ApplyUnitary` operation for simulation

When running against the simulator, your Q# code can call `ApplyUnitary` and pass a unitary matrix represented by a `Std.Math.Complex[][]` along with an array of qubit targets and have the simulator directly apply that unitary to the current sparse state vector.

### Increase minimum versions for Python and Ubuntu

Starting with v1.12, the minimum supported Python version for the qsharp package is Python 3.9. Along with this change, the minimum compatible version of Ubuntu has been increased to 22.04 (see #2061)

**Full Changelog**: [v1.11.1...v1.12](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/compare/v1.11.1...v1.12)

## v1.11.1

We are excited to release v1.11.1 of the Azure Quantum Development Kit! This month's release includes features and bug fixes, such as:

### Configure Pauli Noise Dynamically within Q#

You can now use the `ConfigurePauliNoise` function to dynamically update noise settings during simulation, allowing samples, exercises, or test code to directly set noise used in testing [#1997](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/pull/1997)

### Stabilization of the Microsoft.Quantum.Unstable libraries

The `Arithmetic`, `StatePreparation`, and `TableLookup` libraries have been stabilized and are now available under `Std`. Several samples and libraries have been updated to reflect the new location, while the `Microsoft.Quantum.Unstable` namespace will be preserved for backward compatibility [#2022](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/pull/2022), [#2043](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/pull/2043)

### Support for Qiskit v1.3.0

Changes made to the Qiskit target class in v1.3.0 that broke interoperability with the qsharp Python package are now handled dynamically allowing use of both v1.2 and v1.3 versions of Qiskit [#2050](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/pull/2050)

**Full Changelog**: [v1.10.1...v1.11.1](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/compare/v1.10.1...v1.11.1)

## v1.10.1

We are excited to release v1.10 of the Azure Quantum Development Kit! This month's release includes several new features and improvements including:

### Code editing improvements

Code editing is now greatly improved. A couple of examples of the many improvements:

- **Context aware completions** (#1947) show only the relevant completions for the location. For example, only showing types when in a type position:

  <img width="346" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/347c4fc9-c746-438d-bb1a-998b65375e79">

- **Namespace member** (#1947) completion lists are now provided when drilling into namespaces:

  <img width="346" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09c92c4d-68e6-4fbd-b647-9a4fc064b50c">

- **User Defined Type** (#1954) member completions are now populated

  <img width="383" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/577addec-32f7-465f-9c3d-b865e033b42c">

And much more! Parser error recovery has also been greatly improved so that editor assistance is available whilst mid-edit in many more scenarios.

### Noisy simulation

You can now add Pauli noise to simulations run from Python or VS Code (#1971, #1975, #1980). This can help model the results of running on a real quantum machine for education purposes, and to help develop and test the effectiveness of error correction.

Below shows the results of configuring 5% bit-flip noise in VS Code and running a histogram on the GHZ sample. This would return only $\ket{000}$ and $\ket{111}$ shot results if run in a noise free simulation.

<img width="944" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5274198c-ece5-4049-ac44-ae9e829fc51d">

To see how to use noisy simulation in Python, check out the sample notebook at <https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/blob/main/samples/notebooks/noise.ipynb>

### Refreshed API docs interface

The in-editor Q# API documentation has had a UI refresh (#1978). This is accessed via the "Q#: Show API documentation" command in the command palette when editing a Q# file. The new UX allows you to quickly &amp; easily search &amp; navigate the APIs within your project, referenced projects, and the standard library.

<img width="792" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b6e6026-492f-461d-a9b1-30762915020f">

### File icons

The Q# file extension (.qs) now gets a unique icon in VS Code (#1976)

<img width="279" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6af754e0-b6fa-45b4-b68e-6e379e988cd4">

### Custom measurements and resets

Previously you could define custom gates, but not custom measurement or reset operations. With #1967, #1981, and #1985 this is now possible. This allows for the definition and use of custom operations for quantum simulation and QIR code generation.

Samples for this feature will be added shortly, in the meantime see the test code at <https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/blob/v1.10.1/compiler/qsc/src/codegen/tests.rs#L529> for an example of how this may be used.

### Python telemetry

In this release we have added telemetry to our `qsharp` Python package to collect minimal and anonymous metrics on feature usage and performance. This will allow us to focus our investments going forward on the most valuable areas. Please see the [notes in the package readme](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/blob/v1.10.1/pip/README.md#telemetry) for details on what is collected and how to disable it.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/compare/v1.9.0...v1.10.1

## v1.9.0

The 1.9.0 release of the QDK includes interoperability with Qiskit circuits built upon the core Q# compiler infrastructure.

The Qiskit interop provided by the QDK includes:

- Resource estimation for their Qiskit circuits locally
- Q# Simulation of Qiskit circuits using Q#'s simulation capabilities
- QIR generation from Qiskit circuits leveraging the [modern QDKs advanced code generation capabilities](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/qsharp/integrated-hybrid-support-in-the-azure-quantum-development-kit/).

The [Qiskit interop wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/wiki/Qiskit-Interop) provides a brief overview of the integration while detailed examples, potential errors, and usage with parameterized circuits are demonstrated in the [sample Qiskit interop notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/tree/main/samples/python_interop/qiskit.ipynb).

In addition to the Qiskit interop feature, the language service for Q# will now auto-suggest the new standard library API instead of the legacy `Microsoft.Quantum`-prefixed standard library API. For example, when typing `DumpMachine`, you'll now get a suggested import for `Std.Diagnostics.DumpMachine` instead of `Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics.DumpMachine`.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/compare/v1.8.0...v1.9.0

## v1.8.0

The 1.8.0 release of the QDK includes a number of improvements and fixes, with a focus on refining the project references and editor completions experience.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/compare/v1.7.0...v1.8.0

## v1.7.0

The team is _very_ excited to ship this release. It has some of the most significant improvements to the Q# language in a long time.

### External project references

The biggest feature in this release is the ability to reference other projects and consume their APIs. The projects can be in a separate local directory or published to GitHub. As part of this change, we also introduced `import` and `export` syntax, and generate an implicit namespace hierarchy based on file layout, removing the need for the `namespace` syntax.

For more details see the wiki page at <https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/wiki/Q%23-External-Dependencies-(Libraries)>. (The official documentation will be updated shortly with more details and examples).

### New struct syntax

We're also introducing a new `struct` syntax, and long term see this as the replacement for the current `UDT` syntax. The custom types created by either are largely compatible, but the new syntax is simpler, cleaner, and similar to several popular languages. See more details at <https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/wiki/Q%23-Structs> until the official docs are updated.

### Optional EntryPoint

As well as removing the need to wrap code in a `namespace`, we're also removing the need to specify the `EntryPoint` attribute. If you have one callable called `Main` in your project, this will be the default entry point. (Note: Any specified `@EntryPoint` will still take precedence).

### A new standard library namespace

We've also simplified the namespaces for our standard library. What was previously all under `Microsoft.Quantum` can now be accessed under the `Std` namespace. This reduces visual clutter and highlights what APIs are part of the "standard" library included with Q#.

### Example

Taken together the above provides for a much cleaner language with a simple code sharing mechanism. For example, if your project references another project named `Sparkle` which exports an operation named `Correct` that takes a custom type `Input` with a Double and a Qubit, your entire Q# code to call this can be as simple as:

```qsharp
import Std.Diagnostics.DumpMachine;
import Sparkle.Input, Sparkle.Correct;

operation Main() : Unit {
    use q = Qubit[1];
    let x = new Input { A = 3.14, B = q[0] };

    Correct(x);

    DumpMachine();
    MResetZ(q[0]);
}
```

(Note these changes are additional capabilities. There are no breaking changes or requirements to change code to adopt this release).

### Other notable changes

Many other changes have gone into this release. Some of the main ones include:

- Unitary Hack contributions
  - Save RE widget to .png (#1604)
  - Lint rule: Use Functions (#1579)
  - Add doc for internal AND (#1580)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/compare/v1.6.0...v1.7.0

We hope you enjoy this release. Please log an issue if you need any assistance or to provide feedback. Thanks!

## v1.6.0

Welcome to the v1.6.0 release of the Azure Quantum Development Kit!

The big feature in this release is the ability to compile Q# programs to QIR that require "Adaptive Profile" capabilities. This enables programs to take advantage of the latest capabilities of quantum hardware, such as the ability to perform mid-circuit measurement of qubits, branch based on the results, and perform some classical computations at runtime. For more details, see <https://aka.ms/qdk.qir>.

We've added or updated a number of samples that can leverage Adaptive Profile capabilities, such as the [Three Qubit Repetition Code](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/blob/main/samples/algorithms/ThreeQubitRepetitionCode.qs) and the [Iterative Phase Estimation notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/blob/main/samples/notebooks/iterative_phase_estimation.ipynb). Please do try it out and give us your feedback!

As part of the above work, the previous code generation approach was replaced, even in the non-Adaptive (_"base profile"_) case. Please log an issue if you see any unexpected change in behavior.

Other notable new features include Q# linting support in Jupyter Notebooks, CodeActions in VS Code to fix certain Q# errors, Q# library documentation inside VS Code, and more!
