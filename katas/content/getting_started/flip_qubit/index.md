Exercises are problems that you have to solve by writing Q# code. In each exercise, you'll be presented with placeholder code that you'll have to fill in with the correct solution.

**Input:** A qubit in the $\ket{0}$ state.

**Goal:** Apply the X gate to the qubit, that is, perform a "bit flip" to set the qubit into the $\ket{1}$ state.
