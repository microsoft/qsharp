## <span style="color:blue">Exercise 1</span>: The probability outcomes for a specific state

The qubit is in the following state:
$$\ket \psi = 0.6 \ket 0 + 0.8 \ket 1 \equiv \begin{bmatrix} 0.6 \\ 0.8\end{bmatrix}.$$

If this qubit is measured in the computational basis, what are the outcome probabilities?
