Now that you can generate a single random bit, you can use that logic to create random multi-bit numbers. Let's try first to make a two-bit number by combining two randomly generated bits.

**Input:** None.

**Goal:** Generate a random number in the range $[0, 3]$ with an equal probability of getting each of the four numbers.

**Stretch goal:** Can you do this without allocating qubits in this operation?
