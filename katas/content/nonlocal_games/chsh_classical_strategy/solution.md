If Alice and Bob always return TRUE, they will have a 75% win rate, since TRUE ⊕ TRUE = FALSE, and the AND operation on their input bits will be false with 75% probability.
Alternatively, Alice and Bob could agree to always return FALSE to achieve the same 75% win probability. A classical strategy cannot achieve a higher success probability.
