**Input:** Two unentangled qubits (stored in an array of length 2).
The first qubit will be in state $\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}$, the second - in state $\ket{0}$
(this can be written as two-qubit state $\big(\alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1} \big) \otimes \ket{0} = \alpha \ket{00} + \beta \ket{10}$).

**Goal:** Change the two-qubit state to $\alpha \ket{00} + \beta \ket{11}$.
