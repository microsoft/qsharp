### <span style="color:blue">Exercise 1</span>: Multi-qubit measurement outcome probabilities I

Suppose that a two-qubit system is known to be in the following state:
$$\ket \psi =  \frac{1}{3}\ket {00} + \frac{2}{3} \ket {01} + \frac{2}{3}\ket {11}$$

If all the qubits are measured simultaneously in the computational basis, what are the outcome probabilities?
