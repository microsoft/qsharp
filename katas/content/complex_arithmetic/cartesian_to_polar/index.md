**Input:**
A complex number $x = a + bi$.

**Goal:**
Return the polar representation of $x = re^{i\theta}$, that is, the distance from origin $r$ and phase $\theta$ as a `ComplexPolar`.

* $r$ should be non-negative: $r \geq 0$
* $\theta$ should be between $-\pi$ and $\pi$: $-\pi < \theta \leq \pi$
