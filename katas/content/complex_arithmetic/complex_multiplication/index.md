**Inputs:**

1. A complex number $x = a + bi$.
2. A complex number $y = c + di$.

**Goal:**
Return the product of $x$ and $y$ as a complex number.

Multiplying complex numbers is just like multiplying polynomials. Distribute one of the complex numbers: 
$$(a + bi)(c + di) = a(c + di) + bi(c + di)$$ 
Then multiply through, keeping in mind that $i^2=-1$, and group the real and imaginary terms together.
