    /// # Summary
    /// Implements an oracle for a bent function constructed from the inner

    ///
    /// # Description
    /// This operation defines the Boolean function IP(x_0, ..., x_{n-1}) which
    /// is computed into the phase, i.e., a diagonal operator that maps
    /// |x〉 -> (-1)^{IP(x)} |x〉, where x stands for x=(x_0, ..., x_{n-1}) and all
    /// the x_i are binary. The IP function is defined as
    /// IP(y, z) = y_0 z_0 + y_1 z_1 + ... y_{u-1} z_{u-1} where
    /// y = (y_0, ..., y_{u-1}) and z =  (z_0, ..., z_{u-1}) are two bit vectors
    /// of length u. Notice that the function IP is a Boolean function on n = 2u
    /// bits. IP is a special case of bent function. These are functions for
    /// which the Walsh-Hadamard transform is perfectly flat (in absolute
    /// value).
    /// Because of this flatness, the Walsh-Hadamard spectrum of any bent
    /// function defines a +1/-1 function, i.e., gives rise to another Boolean
    /// function, called the dual bent function. Moreover, for the case of the
    /// IP function it can be shown that IP is equal to its own dual bent
    /// function.
    ///
    /// # Remarks
    /// Notice that a diagonal operator implementing IP between 2 variables y_0
    /// and z_0 is nothing but the AND function between those variables, i.e.,
    /// in phase encoding it is computed by a Controlled-Z gate.
    /// Extending this to an XOR of the AND of more variables, as required in
    /// the definition of the IP function can then be accomplished by applying
    /// several Controlled-Z gates between the respective inputs.
