# Output data

In this document, we describe all output parameters which are printed by the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator. Second-level headings contain one group in the output that consists of a header and a table with resource estimation data. Each third-level heading corresponds to an entry, which is preceded by a short description text in italic and a long description text. The short description text will be always visible in the third column next to the value, whereas the long description text will be visible as a tooltip when hovering over the corresponding row in the table. The description texts may contain some variable names such as `variable` or $\mathtt{variable}$ in formulas. These will be substituted by the actual computed values extracted from the resource estimates.

## Physical resource estimates

### Runtime

[//]: # "physicalCountsFormatted/runtime"

_Total runtime_

This is a runtime estimate for the execution time of the algorithm. In general, the execution time corresponds to the duration of one logical cycle (`logicalQubit/logicalCycleTime` nanosecs) multiplied by the `physicalCounts/breakdown/algorithmicLogicalDepth` logical cycles to run the algorithm. If however the duration of a single T factory (here: `tfactory/runtime` nanosecs) is larger than the algorithm runtime, we extend the number of logical cycles artificially in order to exceed the runtime of a single T factory.

### rQOPS

[//]: # "physicalCountsFormatted/rqops"

_Reliable quantum operations per second_

The value is computed as the number of logical qubits after layout (`physicalCounts/breakdown/algorithmicLogicalQubits`) (with a logical error rate of `physicalCountsFormatted/requiredLogicalQubitErrorRate`) multiplied by the clock frequency (`logicalQubit/logicalCyclesPerSecond`), which is the number of logical cycles per second.

### Physical qubits

[//]: # "physicalCountsFormatted/physicalQubits"

_Number of physical qubits_

This value represents the total number of physical qubits, which is the sum of `physicalCounts/breakdown/physicalQubitsForAlgorithm` physical qubits to implement the algorithm logic, and `physicalCounts/breakdown/physicalQubitsForTfactories` physical qubits to execute the T factories that are responsible to produce the T states that are consumed by the algorithm.

## Resource estimates breakdown

### Logical algorithmic qubits

[//]: # "physicalCountsFormatted/algorithmicLogicalQubits"

_Number of logical qubits for the algorithm after layout_

Laying out the logical qubits in the presence of nearest-neighbor constraints requires additional logical qubits. In particular, to layout the $Q_{\rm alg} = \mathtt{logicalCounts/numQubits}$ logical qubits in the input algorithm, we require in total $2 \cdot Q_{\rm alg} + \lceil \sqrt{8 \cdot Q_{\rm alg}}\rceil + 1 = \mathtt{physicalCounts/breakdown/algorithmicLogicalQubits}$ logical qubits.

### Algorithmic depth

[//]: # "physicalCountsFormatted/algorithmicLogicalDepth"

_Number of logical cycles for the algorithm_

To execute the algorithm using _Parallel Synthesis Sequential Pauli Computation_ (PSSPC), operations are scheduled in terms of multi-qubit Pauli measurements, for which assume an execution time of one logical cycle. Based on the input algorithm, we require one multi-qubit measurement for the `logicalCounts/measurementCount` single-qubit measurements, the `logicalCounts/rotationCount` arbitrary single-qubit rotations, and the `logicalCounts/tCount` T gates, three multi-qubit measurements for each of the `logicalCounts/cczCount` CCZ and `logicalCounts/ccixCount` CCiX gates in the input program, as well as `physicalCountsFormatted/numTsPerRotation` multi-qubit measurements for each of the `logicalCounts/rotationDepth` non-Clifford layers in which there is at least one single-qubit rotation with an arbitrary angle rotation.

### Number of T factories

### Physical T factory qubits

[//]: # "physicalCountsFormatted/physicalQubitsForTfactories"

_Number of physical qubits for the T factories_

Each T factory requires `tfactory/physicalQubits` physical qubits and we run `physicalCounts/breakdown/numTfactories` in parallel, therefore we need $\mathtt{physicalCounts/breakdown/physicalQubitsForTfactories} = \mathtt{tfactory/physicalQubits} \cdot \mathtt{physicalCounts/breakdown/numTfactories}$ qubits.

The minimum T state error rate is obtained by dividing the T distillation error probability `physicalCountsFormatted/errorBudgetTstates` by the total number of T states `physicalCounts/breakdown/numTstates`.

### Number of T states per rotation

[//]: # "physicalCountsFormatted/numTsPerRotation"

_Number of T states to implement a rotation with an arbitrary angle_

The number of T states to implement a rotation with an arbitrary angle is $\lceil 0.53 \log_2(\mathtt{logicalCounts/rotationCount} / \mathtt{errorBudget/rotations}) + 5.3\rceil$ [[arXiv:2203.10064](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10064)]. For simplicity, we use this formula for all single-qubit arbitrary angle rotations, and do not distinguish between best, worst, and average cases.

## Assumed error budget

### Total error budget

[//]: # "physicalCountsFormatted/errorBudget"

_Total error budget for the algorithm_

The total error budget sets the overall allowed error for the algorithm, i.e., the number of times it is allowed to fail. Its value must be between 0 and 1 and the default value is 0.001, which corresponds to 0.1%, and means that the algorithm is allowed to fail once in 1000 executions. This parameter is highly application specific. For example, if one is running Shor's algorithm for factoring integers, a large value for the error budget may be tolerated as one can check that the output are indeed the prime factors of the input. On the other hand, a much smaller error budget may be needed for an algorithm solving a problem with a solution which cannot be efficiently verified. This budget $\epsilon = \epsilon_{\log} + \epsilon_{\rm dis} + \epsilon_{\rm syn}$ is uniformly distributed and applies to errors $\epsilon_{\log}$ to implement logical qubits, an error budget $\epsilon_{\rm dis}$ to produce T states through distillation, and an error budget $\epsilon_{\rm syn}$ to synthesize rotation gates with arbitrary angles. Note that for distillation and rotation synthesis, the respective error budgets $\epsilon_{\rm dis}$ and $\epsilon_{\rm syn}$ are uniformly distributed among all T states and all rotation gates, respectively. If there are no rotation gates in the input algorithm, the error budget is uniformly distributed to logical errors and T state errors.

## Assumptions

- _More details on the following lists of assumptions can be found in the paper [Accessing requirements for scaling quantum computers and their applications](https://aka.ms/AQ/RE/Paper)._
- **Uniform independent physical noise.** We assume that the noise on physical qubits and physical qubit operations is the standard circuit noise model. In particular we assume error events at different space-time locations are independent and that error rates are uniform across the system in time and space.
- **Efficient classical computation.** We assume that classical overhead (compilation, control, feedback, readout, decoding, etc.) does not dominate the overall cost of implementing the full quantum algorithm.
- **Extraction circuits for planar quantum ISA.** We assume that stabilizer extraction circuits with similar depth and error correction performance to those for standard surface and Hastings-Haah code patches can be constructed to implement all operations of the planar quantum ISA (instruction set architecture).
- **Uniform independent logical noise.** We assume that the error rate of a logical operation is approximately equal to its space-time volume (the number of tiles multiplied by the number of logical time steps) multiplied by the error rate of a logical qubit in a standard one-tile patch in one logical time step.
- **Negligible Clifford costs for synthesis.** We assume that the space overhead for synthesis and space and time overhead for transport of magic states within magic state factories and to synthesis qubits are all negligible.
- **Smooth magic state consumption rate.** We assume that the rate of T state consumption throughout the compiled algorithm is almost constant, or can be made almost constant without significantly increasing the number of logical time steps for the algorithm.
